title: "RESTful APIs"

RESTful APIs are used by some web services to provide an easy way to get data from the service.
These APIs allow developers to make requests over HTTP using JSON (or sometimes XML) by calling
methods provided by the API. Some APIs require an API key to authorize requests; this is typically
noted in the documentation for the API.

##Implememtation of APIs
In many cases, there are official or unofficial language-specific implementations of a
service's API. These implementations typically have documentation that shows the methods
provided by the implementation.
