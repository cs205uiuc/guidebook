# Submitting your work

After working on your exercise, you want to commit the changes to your local repository and then push those changes to the server.
To do this:

1. In your CS 205 Workbook directory, run `git add -u` to add all changed files
2. Run `git status` to view what files are about to be committed
3. Run `git commit -m "MESSAGE"`, where MESSAGE is a message to associate your commit.
4. Run `git push origin master` to push your changes to your gitlab

After you have had a successful `push`, your code is submitted.  You can `push` your code as many times as you'd like, only
your most recent submission will be used for grading.
